    "prose_1": "In heated debate over why our November electricity bill was higher than our October bill and who was to blame, we found a silver lining. It was not that the November bill was more than usual, but that the October was less than usual. As a possible nod to some underlying pattern, members in Spec pooled our electric bill data, and found this pattern persisted. Go ahead, and peak at what we saw.",
    "prose_2": "It turns out, electric bills across California reaped this reward in October. But who is rewarding us? And why are they giving us free money! We can thank a state-wide climate initiative for that.",
    "prose_3":" What we unfolded was the <a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/ClimateCredit/\">California Climage Credit</a>, a credit paid for by large power plants and other greenhouse-gas-emitting corporatations applied to utility bills twice a year. Put simply, state regulation requires corporate powers to pay for their climate damage, and utility payers are subsidized. This policy is a forward stride for reversing climate change is, and it's not the only one."
